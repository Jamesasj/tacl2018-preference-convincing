\section{Experiments}\label{sec:expts}

The first dataset contains a number of pairwise convincingness preference labels for a set of arguments from a crowd of workers. Each label is associated with two arguments and expresses whether a worker in the crowd found the first argument most convincing, the second argument, or had no preference.  

The task is to train the models then predict the preference labels for held-out data. Each method can be assessed in terms of classification accuracy, since the labels have three possible values. In the first set of experiments we evaluate the baselines and the different methods for modelling correlations between workers' preferences. In the second set of experiments, we assess the value of different language features. Finally, the third experiment evaluates approaches that integrate both argument features and models of preference correlations.
