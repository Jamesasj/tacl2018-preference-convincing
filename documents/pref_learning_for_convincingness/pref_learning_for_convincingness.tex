\begin{itemize}
  \item Motivation: finding well-written and convincing arguments to enable better decision-making, analyse public opinion
  \item Need tools that can learn to identify convincing arguments in new topics and domains from small amounts of data
  \item Pairwise preferences provide a way for multiple people to communicate the relative convincingness of arguments 
  \item Implicit preferences can be elicited from user actions, such as selecting a document from a list given its summary to read in more detail
  \item We propose a scalable approach to preference learning using stochastic variational inference to learn a Gaussian process model
  \item We show how Bayesian approach to preference learning can be applied to high-dimensional text problems
  \item The approach outperforms SVMs and neural networks when data is sparse or noisy  
  \item ...and achieves state-of-the art performance for predicting argument convincingness given sufficient data
  \item We show how our Bayesian approach enables more effective active learning, thereby reducing the amount of data required to model argument convincingness in new domains
  \item We develop a gradient-based approach to automatic relevance determination that enables us to identify the most informative features for predicting arguments when the input space contains tens of thousands of dimensions
  \item Our analysis shows that word embeddings and linguistic features contain complementary information that boost performance when both types of features are used.
\end{itemize}
