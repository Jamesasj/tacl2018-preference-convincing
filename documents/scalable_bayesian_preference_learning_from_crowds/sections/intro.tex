\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Many tasks are more suited to pairwise comparisons than classification etc. 
Crowds of non-expert annotators may label more accurately if presented with pairs. 
Implicit feedback may be taken from user actions in an application that can be represented as a preference, such as choosing
an option over other options.

There are several works for learning from noisy pairwise comparisons so far (Horvitz et al. 2013 or something like that?). 
However, these do not provide a way to take account of item features or to model different but valid subjective viewpoints. 
They assume there is a single ground truth and can therefore model only one task and one user's (or a consensus of all users) preferences at once. 

Work by Felt et al. 2015, Simpson et al. 2015 etc. shows that item features are particularly useful when combining crowdsourced data. A Gaussian process has not been tested for this purpose before?

GP preference learning presents a way to learn from noisy preferences but assumes constant noise and a single underlying preference function. 
The collaborative Gaussian process (Houlsby et al. 2012) learns multiple users' preferences. 
However existing implementations do not scale and do not identify ground truth. 

We show how to scale it using SVI and how to use the model to identify ground truth from subjective preferences.
