To-Do list for this paper (Paper A):

1. Complete editing of experiment section text.
2. Complete editing of Conclusions section text.
3. Create new ML paper *[Paper D] Scalable GP Preference Learning* outline. This can combine with technical bits from the personalised
argumentation paper; also take on the crowdsourcing angle --> using the collaborative model to de-noise the crowdsourced data.
4. Move SVI equations to paper D and replace with very short references.
5. From experiment section move to paper D: comparisons of optimised and MH methods in table 3. 
6. From experiment section move to paper D: comparisons of optimised and MH methods in table 2. 
Retain best results. Can retain some of this comparison where it pertains to "applying GPs to NLP problems in practice". E.g. we show results using ARD, which required 2 hours per fold; using MH required only 10 minutes to produce results within 2%. 
7. Cut the "All" dataset?
8. From experiment section move to paper D: non-optimised results for different embeddings.
9. Expand background
